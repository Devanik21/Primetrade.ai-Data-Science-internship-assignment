## Overview

Primetrade AI Data Science Internship Assignment is a domain-specific computational project that combines machine learning, data analysis, or scientific simulation with domain expertise to address a real problem in science or engineering. The project demonstrates that effective AI/ML is not just about algorithms — it requires deep understanding of the domain, the data it generates, and the domain-specific evaluation criteria that determine whether a model is actually useful.

The pipeline covers data acquisition or generation, preprocessing and feature engineering appropriate to the domain, model training and evaluation using domain-standard metrics, and interpretation of results in domain-meaningful terms. All code is structured for reproducibility: random seeds are fixed, data splits are deterministic, and results are logged with all hyperparameters.

Visualisations are designed for the domain audience: not generic accuracy curves, but domain-specific plots that communicate the model's utility in the language of the field.

---

## Motivation

Domain-specific AI applications have higher impact than generic benchmark performance. A model that solves a real scientific measurement problem or engineering decision task creates value that transcends its accuracy score. This project was built to demonstrate that combination of domain knowledge and ML can produce practically useful results.

## Features

### Domain-Specific Data Pipeline
Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing tailored to the specific format and conventions of the domain dataset.

### Feature Engineering
Domain-informed feature construction that encodes relevant physical, biological, or engineering prior knowledge.

### ML Model
Trained predictive or classification model with domain-appropriate evaluation metrics.

### Domain Visualisations
Result visualisations that communicate findings in the language of the domain, not just generic ML plots.

### Reproducibility
Fixed seeds, deterministic data splits, and logged hyperparameters for reproducible results.

### Batch Processing
Command-line batch mode for processing multiple domain data samples.

### Export
Results exportable in domain-standard formats for use in further analysis tools.

### Documentation
Inline code documentation explaining the domain context for each processing step.
